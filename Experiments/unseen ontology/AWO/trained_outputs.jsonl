It does not have explicitly defined domain or range restrictions. This property is a subproperty of \"is-part-of,\" indicating a more specific parthood relation where the part is strictly contained within another entity.

Output only the questions, separated by ` | ` (pipe with spaces). \nProperty name: is-part-of\nDescription: The property \"is-part-of\" is defined as both transitive and reflexive, meaning that if an entity is part of another, and that entity is part of a third, then the first is part of the third, and every entity is considered part of itself. There are no explicit domain or range restrictions, no super-properties, and no defined inverse property.

It has no explicitly defined domain or range restrictions, indicating it can relate any entities. \"has-part\" has \"is-part-of\" as its inverse property, but it is not specified as a sub-property of any other property.
