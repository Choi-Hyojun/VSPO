Bulk is equivalent to either MixedStuff or StructuredPureStuff, and cannot be UnstructuredPureStuff. In practical contexts, particularly in the food industry, Bulk refers to goods such as soy beans, coffee, nuts, pet food, tea, whole grains, and sugar—items typically handled and measured in aggregate amounts rather than as individual units.

It refers to the role played by a substance within the context of a colloidal system, specifically as the phase that is distributed throughout another phase (the ContinuousMedium). The relationship (colloidFormingRelation) exists between the DispersedPhase and the ContinuousMedium themselves, rather than their respective bearers (stuffs), emphasizing that simply combining the substance bearers does not suffice to form a colloid.

It represents the general state in which a substance (or \"stuff\") exists, such as solid, liquid, or gas. While it is relevant for describing the phase of a specific material (e.g., water as ice, liquid, or vapor), the class also accommodates cases like colloids, where the states of mixed components are important.
