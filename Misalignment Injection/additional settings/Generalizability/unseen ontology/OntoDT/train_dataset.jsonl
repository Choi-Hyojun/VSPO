Bulk is equivalent to either MixedStuff or StructuredPureStuff, and cannot be UnstructuredPureStuff. In practical contexts, particularly in the food industry, Bulk refers to goods such as soy beans, coffee, nuts, pet food, tea, whole grains, and sugar—items typically handled and measured in aggregate amounts rather than as individual units. The class accommodates various granularities (e.g., bags of nuts or packets of cookies are counted in units of the contained item type) and encompasses different material compositions, such as StructuredPureStuff (like sugar), HomogenousMixedStuff (such as stabilized peanut butter), and HeterogenousMixedStuff (e.g., pet food), highlighting the concept’s versatility in bulk goods handling and classification.\nAxiom: {'subClassOf': ['Stuff', '(([hasGranuleType some (Molecule or MultiMoleculeParticle)] or [hasPartStuff some Stuff]) and ([hasGranuleType only (Molecule or MultiMoleculeParticle)] or [hasPartStuff only Stuff]))']}\nGenerated CQs:", "output": "Is Bulk classified under either MixedStuff or StructuredPureStuff categories? | Which concepts are more specific than the union of MixedStuff and StructuredPureStuff, such as Bulk? | Into which overarching groups does Bulk fit within the ontology: MixedStuff, StructuredPureStuff, or both?

In the literature, PureStuff has also been referred to as 'Unstructured stuff' and 'discrete stuff', and is characterized by being composed of a single kind of molecule or atomic constituent—for example, water composed only of H₂O molecules or pure manganese made up solely of manganese atoms.

Furthermore, a Solution must have a number of phases exactly equal to one. The class captures chemical systems where the mixing occurs at the molecular level, resulting in homogeneity; this applies to solutions in all physical states (solid, liquid, or gas).

Members of this class are defined by having at least two different granule types (each being a Molecule or MultiMoleculeParticle) and consisting of a minimum of two distinct parts, each being either MixedStuff or PureStuff. Additionally, every HeterogeneousMixture exhibits exactly one instance of UnevenDistribution, ensuring that its components are not distributed uniformly. As described, a HeterogeneousMixture is a combination of different substances, often with visibly different particle sizes, which do not react chemically and can be separated by physical means (such as filtration).

While it is relevant for describing the phase of a specific material (e.g., water as ice, liquid, or vapor), the class also accommodates cases like colloids, where the states of mixed components are important.

This means all constituent atoms are of the same atomic type, corresponding to the ontological equivalent of a chemical element (e.g., a quantity of helium or gold).
