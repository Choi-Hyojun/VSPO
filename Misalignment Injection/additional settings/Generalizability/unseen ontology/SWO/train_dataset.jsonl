Furthermore, a Solution must have a number of phases exactly equal to one. The class captures chemical systems where the mixing occurs at the molecular level, resulting in homogeneity; this applies to solutions in all physical states (solid, liquid, or gas).

Members of this class are defined by having at least two different granule types (each being a Molecule or MultiMoleculeParticle) and consisting of a minimum of two distinct parts, each being either MixedStuff or PureStuff. Additionally, every HeterogeneousMixture exhibits exactly one instance of UnevenDistribution, ensuring that its components are not distributed uniformly. As described, a HeterogeneousMixture is a combination of different substances, often with visibly different particle sizes, which do not react chemically and can be separated by physical means (such as filtration).
